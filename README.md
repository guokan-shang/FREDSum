# FREDSum

FREDSum is a corpus of summaries of French political debates presented in the paper "FREDSum: A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates"

Each debate is divided by topic (employment, retirement, nuclear energy, etc.)

The corpus contains four main folders:
- `transcript`: one transcript per topic (e.g., Royale_Bayroux--Partie_5_Economie.txt)
- `summary_extractive`: two extractive summaries per topic
- `summary_abstractive`: for each topic, there are three abstractive summaries, one in each of the following three formats (organized in three subfolders `1`, `2`, `3`)
    1. summaries that limit co-reference by using proper names instead of pronouns
    2. summaries based on the extractive summaries rather than the transcript
    3. summaries created in a natural way
- `summary_abstractive_prediction`: abstractive summaries generated by three models: Barthez, ChatGPT and Open Assistant (based on Llama 30b). Please note that there are no predicted summaries for the debate 'Destaing_Mitterand_2'.

This corpus was created as a part of the SUMM-RE (ANR-20-CE23-0017) and CORTEX2 (Horizon Europe CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-25) research projects.

# FREDSum: A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates

## Overview

This repository contains the FREDSum dataset, a comprehensive collection of transcripts and metadata from various political and public debates in France. The dataset aims to provide researchers, linguists, and data scientists with a rich source of debate content for analysis and natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes transcripts from a range of French political debates and discussions. Each transcript is provided along with abstractive and extractive summaries.

### Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

- `transcripts/`: This folder contains the debate transcripts.
  - Each file is named in the format `Speakers--Partie_X_Theme.txt`. The name structure is consistant through folders for usage purposes.
- `summary_extractive`: This folder contains two sub folders representing each source for extractive summaries
- `summary_abstractive` : This folder contains three sub folders representing each source for abstractive summaries
	- 1) Contains summaries aiming at limiting co-reference resolution by using proper names instead of pronouns, and keeps original utterance structures intact
	- 2) Contains summaries aiming to keep original speaker utterances in the style they were spoken
	- 3) Contains summaries that have been written freely
- `summary_abstractive_prediction` : This folder contains abstractive summaries generated by three models: 
	- [Barthez](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.740.pdf)
	- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
	- [Open Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) (based on Llama 30b). 
- Please note that there are no predicted summaries for the debate 'Destaing_Mitterand_2'.


The dataset can also be found on Ortolang at [https://hdl.handle.net/11403/fredsum](https://hdl.handle.net/11403/fredsum).

Additionnally, data from the French National Assembly and French Senate that were used to continue the pretraining of the Barthez language model, as described in the paper "FREDSum : A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates", will be available in the coming days on [FREDSum Parliament](https://hdl.handle.net/11403/fredsum-parliament).

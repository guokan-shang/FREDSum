# FREDSum: A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates

## Overview

This repository contains the FREDSum dataset, a comprehensive collection of transcripts and metadata from various political and public debates in France. The dataset aims to provide researchers, linguists, and data scientists with a rich source of debate content for analysis and natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes transcripts from a range of French political debates and discussions. Each transcript is provided along with abstractive and extractive summaries.

### Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

- `transcripts`: This folder contains the debate transcripts.
  - Each file is named in the format `Speakers--Partie_X_Theme.txt`. The name structure is consistant through folders for usage purposes.
- `summary_extractive`: This folder contains two sub folders, one for each of the two annotators who made the extractive summaries.
- `summary_abstractive`: This folder contains three sub folders corresponding to three different types of abstractive summary as follows:
	- 1) Contains summaries that aim to limit co-reference resolution by using proper names instead of pronouns and to keep original utterance structures intact.
	- 2) Contains summaries that aim to keep original speaker utterances in the style they were spoken.
	- 3) Contains summaries that have been written freely.
- `summary_abstractive_prediction`: This folder contains abstractive summaries generated by three models: 
	- [Barthez](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.740.pdf)
	- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
	- [Open Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) (based on Llama 30b). 

	Please note that there are no predicted summaries for the debate 'Destaing_Mitterand_2'.
- `FREDSum_test.json`: a list of the names of the test files.

Additionnally, data from the French National Assembly and French Senate that were used to continue the pretraining of the Barthez language model, as described in the paper "FREDSum: A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates", is available at [FREDSum Parliament](https://hdl.handle.net/11403/fredsum-parliament).
